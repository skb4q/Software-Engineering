# WordWeaver
backend of the multilinugal context aware dictionary 

This repo includes the server scripts, testing scripts, test files, and word sense disambiguation scripts for the multilingual context aware dictionary. 

To run the server we used ngrok.

https://ngrok.com/

The code generated by the ngrok command must be pasted into the frontend portion of the book when using the free version.

The server script Server.py is used to create a flask server which calls the WSD module.

The WSD module then uses wordnet, spacy, and calls on a few different APIs to disambiguate the word in English, French, or Spanish.

note: sometimes failures occur with Spanish and French due to words not being stemmed properly, but less so than the demo showed.

To use the WSD module as a seperate python module, copy it into your projects directory and import it like normal. The function get_def() takes a JSON object in the following format.

{

  "language":"English" //spa for Spanish and fra for French

  "context":"A string of English words"
  
  "word":"of" //the word needs to be in the string but can be in the source language

}

NLTK: Used to get definitions required also for pywsd. http://www.nltk.org/

OxfordDictionary: Used for definitions of stopwords. https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/

flask: used for server. http://flask.pocoo.org/

request: used for server. http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
