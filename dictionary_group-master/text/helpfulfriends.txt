“What are you making?” Snake asks Gorilla. “Can Mouse and I play too?”

Gorilla shows her kite to Snake and Mouse. “I like that kite!” says Mouse. “We can have fun flying it.” 

Gorilla says: “Thanks, Mouse. I made it myself! I drew a big blue fish on it too.” Then Gorilla gives the kite to Mouse. He is very excited.

Mouse holds the kite and then he is pulled across the yard.  The wind blows hard on the kite and the tiny Mouse goes up!

Gorilla and Snake watch the kite pulling Mouse up, up, up into the sky!

Mouse and the kite are flying high up to the clouds.

Gorilla and Snake chase after Mouse and the kite. Gorilla is running fast and Snake is slithering quickly across the zoo.  But they cannot catch Mouse and the kite.

“Look! There is Giraffe!” says Gorilla. ““She is very tall!  Her head is almost as high as the clouds. She can help Mouse.”

Mouse yells, “HELP me! HELP me, Giraffe!” But Mouse is too high for Giraffe to reach. 

Then Giraffe tells Gorilla and Snake, “I have an idea.” She takes off her hat and holds it out for Mouse. “Can Mouse fall into the hat?”

But, Mouse is scared.  His friends say: “1…2…3…. Jump, Mouse!” Then Mouse jumps into the hat.

“Hooray!” The friends cheer.  Mouse is happy now and not scared. “Look, Snake,” says Gorilla. “Giraffe saved Mouse with her hat.”

THE END
